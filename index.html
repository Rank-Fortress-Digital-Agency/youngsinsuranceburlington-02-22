                    There are many risks associated with driving without high-risk auto insurance in Ontario. One of the most obvious is that you may be pulled over and ticketed for driving without insurance. If you are involved in an accident, you may not be covered by your insurance if you are considered a high-risk driver. This could leave you responsible for all of the costs associated with the accident, including damages to your vehicle and any injuries or property damage that occurred. In addition, having high-risk auto insurance can help you to get lower rates on car insurance overall.

                <h2>
                    What is high-risk auto insurance and how does it work?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    High-risk auto insurance is a type of insurance designed for drivers who are considered <a href="https://youngsinsuranceburlington.ca/personal/auto-insurance/high-risk/%20">high risk</a>. This can include drivers who have been convicted of driving offenses, have had too many accidents, or have received tickets for driving offenses. It can also include drivers under the age of 25 or over the age of 65.
                </p>
                <p>
                    High-risk auto insurance is typically more expensive than regular car insurance, as it is considered a higher-risk product. However, it is essential to remember that high-risk auto insurance provides protection if you are involved in an accident. Without this type of insurance, you could end up facing significant financial difficulties if you are at fault in an accident.

                <h2>
                    Why is it important?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ontario’s Insurance Board recommends all drivers have high-risk auto insurance. For a driver who does not have this type of insurance, their risks are high if they are in an accident. This type of insurance is designed for drivers who have been convicted of driving offenses or have had accidents in the past.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If a driver without this insurance is in an accident, they may be sued for damages by the other driver. The court may also order the driver to pay the other driver’s legal costs. These costs can be very expensive and may even lead to bankruptcy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another risk of not having high-risk auto insurance is that the driver’s license may be suspended. This can happen if the driver is involved in an accident and does not have adequate insurance coverage. A suspended license means that the driver cannot drive anywhere in Canada.

                    There are a few factors that can make someone a high-risk driver. <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/E8w1dYv7ectKC3bC9">Youngs Insurance’s High-Risk Auto Insurance Ontario</a> covers those drivers who may have trouble finding coverage due to their age, driving history, or vehicle type.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the most significant factors that lead to someone becoming a high-risk driver is their age. Teenagers and young adults are more likely to get into accidents because of their inexperience behind the wheel. In addition, they are also more likely to be ticketed for traffic violations. This can lead to an increase in premiums or even make it difficult for them to find insurance coverage at all.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another common factor that leads to someone becoming a high-risk driver is their driving history. If someone has been convicted of multiple DUIs or has received a lot of tickets, they will likely be considered a high-risk driver by insurance companies.
                </p>
